The production of the 2025 Global *Bit List* of Endangered Digital Materials is made possible through the generous support of the *Bit List* Council and their respective networks. All entries to the *Bit List* are reviewed by these dedicated organizations which represent global expertise in the preservation of the listed digital species. The DPC gratefully acknowledges all of their support, commitment and contributions towards the publication of the *Bit List*.
