comments: |-
  In regard to preservation actions, rooting methods for old smart TVs are often non-existent or hard to do (and sometimes manageable when they do exist); it is challenging to buy or find owners of older smart TV units with removed-from-the-store apps that have rootable versions and/or is willing to root.

  The content these apps contain can hold social and cultural significance; they can provide a history of television, entertainment, and exclusive or unique content only made available through the apps specifically designed for smart TVs. Although there is a small community of people interested in old smart TVs and a bigger one focused on new ones too, in the future, when the technologies become even more obsolete, there will be researchers and others interested in looking back at Smart TVs as a piece of the history of entertainment and even culture.

    comment: The nominator of this entry provided UlangoTV as an example of an archive of old smart TV apps. The domain of UlangoTV, an app that aggregated live Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) streams, was taken down by the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE). Domain records show that Ulango.tv is now owned by the Motion Picture Association, indicating an agreement and handover took place; at the time of writing, servers hosting the smart TV app archive are currently in an evidence locker with no indications for releasing without paying to get the full archive.

**2023 Review**

This was a new Bit List entry added in 2023 to draw attention to the particular challenges of content and software preservation for apps designed and used for smart TVs. While there are some similarities with the ‘Smartphone Apps’ entry in regard to device dependency, frequent updates, and lack of preservation interest or mandate by companies that publish them, this entry focuses on the distinct risks relating to the availability and access to apps made specifically for smart TVs, which can be more short-lived, variable, and challenging to access and find a rootable version for preservation actions. These apps, designed and used specifically for smart TVs, are deprecated quickly or undergo frequent updates. It is challenging to maintain version control and preserve the content. Preservation efforts often depend upon the availability and access to rootable versions of the apps by the companies that publish them, particularly for older TVs that are no longer manufactured. There also remains a lack of clear agency or mandate to record or collect from corporate owners and barriers to access for preservation efforts outside this context.

The 2023 Bit List Council recommended that the next major review consider creating a new Broadcast species group where this entry may be better suited. Council members additionally noted that it may be better to have a broader entry for smart device apps rather than specifically ‘Smart TV Apps’ and ‘Smartphone Apps’ as separate standalone entries. The risks posed by these apps can apply to a variety of devices; for example, before Smartphones, there were PDAs, and there are now Smart fridges, set-top-boxes, fire sticks, e-book readers, and other devices which have apps. For this reason, they recommended that the next major review for the Bit List includes a rescoping of Smart TV Apps and Smartphone Apps to consider: What differentiates these apps from others? What cultural heritage purpose do these apps serve? Are organizations collecting them? Are there distinct aggravating factors or risk profiles?

**2024 Interim Review**

These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
