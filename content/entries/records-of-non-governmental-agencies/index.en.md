title: Records of Non-Governmental Agencies
description: Records of independent agencies and contractors that act on behalf
  of the state in the delivery of public services, and which may be present in
  many diverse forms, but for which the NGO or contractors may lack the capacity
  to meet the complex digital preservation requirements that arise, or may have
  a business motive to minimize or ignore requirements for the maintenance of
  the record.
examples: Born digital records of small and medium-sized agencies;
  fasting-changing internal manuals, advice or policies shared on intranets or
  EDRMS; records of care services; historic guidelines and manuals which
  evidence 'best practice at the time'; Documentation supporting long-lived
  contractual relations like Public Finance Initiatives; Organizational Slack
  channels; network drives; EDRMS; Email

classification: critically-endangered
imminence: 4

trends:
  - year: 2023
    trend: no-change
    classification: critically-endangered
  - year: 2024
    trend: no-change
    classification: critically-endangered
hazards: Lack of preservation infrastructure; conflation of backup with
  preservation; loss of authenticity or integrity; Long-lived business
  processes; poor storage; churn of staff; significant volumes or diversity of
  data; poorly developed digitization specifications; ill-informed records
  management; poorly developed migration or normalizations specifications;
  longstanding protocols or procedures that apply unsuitable paper processes to
  digital materials; encryption; political instability; lack of sustained
  funding; denial of responsibility; failure to include archives within contract
  from commissioning agency; Uncertainty over IPR or the presence of orphaned
  works
mitigations: Well managed data infrastructure; preservation enabled at the point
  of creation; carefully managed authenticity; use of persistent identifiers;
  finding aids; well managed records management processes; application of
  records management standards; recognition of preservation requirements at
  highest levels; strategic investment in digital preservation; transfer
  protocols to public archive; participation in digital preservation community

  There is a large variation in the types of records held by NGOs. Additionally,
  the quality of digital preservation performed by NGOs can vary widely.
  Therefore, the same approach to scoring was taken for this entry as the one
  above.


  We consider records of NGOs to be at greater risk due to there being less regulation, and the regulations that exist being less stringently enforced.


  An additional risk factor for these records is a blurring of the lines of responsibility, which can lead to records 'falling through gaps', or to difficulties funding digital preservation practice. This can be further complicated by outdated legislation which does not take into account the complexity of privatisation and public/private partnerships. For example, the legislation that PROV operates under is 50 years old. This, in turn, can lead to regulation and enforcement being more complex than it is for government agencies.

    comment: The Grenfell Tower fire and Grenfell Tower Inquiry illustrate the
      precarity of local government records, especially when third-party
      contractors are involved. Not only does it show the potential impact of
      aggravating conditions for Records of Local Government, but it also
      applies to those of Records of Non-Governmental Agencies.
  - title: Public Records (Scotland) Act 2011

    authors: National Records of Scotland
    comment: There can be some grey areas depending on the legislative context. The
      Public Records Scotland Act 2011, for example, covers government agencies
      and any non-government org contracted to do work on behalf of government
      agencies.

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2019 as a subset of a previous entry for ‘Records of long duration from Local Government or Other Government Agencies.’ The split was intended to allow greater concentration on the challenges that these different types of agencies face. Non-governmental organizations typically operate across a broad range of digital formats and services acting on behalf of the public sector. The 2020 Jury noted the trend towards greater risk based on 2020 being a year of significant political and economic upheaval, putting additional strain on NGOs in these circumstances where already vulnerable records are likely to be at greater risk. Trends towards greater risk were also noted by the 2021 Jury and 2022 Taskforce, contributing examples like Grenfell to demonstrate the precarity of non-government agencies, especially when these risks overlap with those of local government, resulting in significance and impact of loss, the impetus for action and call to governing frameworks failing in enforcement for these agencies (e.g., examining current recordkeeping regimes keeping them accountable).

The 2023 Council generally agreed with the Critically Endangered classification, with the overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend). The 2023 Council additionally recommended revisiting and rescoping this entry as part of the next major revision of the Bit List. Some Council members recommended splitting this entry into separate entries to differentiate the various risks associated with different types of digital non-governmental records. Others suggested that it is perhaps not appropriate to have a distinct entry or split entries for records of non-governmental agencies but rather provide examples of different kinds of these digital materials in and across other entries.

**2024 Interim Review**

These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
