  - comment: The 2020 Medical Facilities Under Fire report by the Syrian Archive.,
      which provides information on how The Syrian Archive and its partners
      (Syrians for Truth and Justice, Justice for Life) analyzed and verified
      pattern of attacks by cross referencing a combination of open-source
      visual content, flight observation data, and witness statements. Through
      collecting, verifying and reporting investigative findings from these
      incidents, the authors hope to preserve critical information that may be
      used for advocacy purposes or as evidence in future proceedings seeking
      legal accountability.

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2019 and subsequently split into three elements by the Jury, relating to current, recent and historic sources. This entry relates to materials used in evidence in completed investigations, as well as those presented to courts or other investigatory agencies. Social media companies have a policy to take down or suppress content that they consider propaganda for terrorist groups. This has had the unintended consequence of deleting or suppressing content used in open source investigation or fact-checking for journalistic or judicial purposes, which may impede refutation or prosecution. However, a new generation of cloud-based services now allows investigators to copy and stabilize content to private accounts in the process of investigating it, so the ethical requirements of social media companies and the integrity of the investigation are both served. The 2020 Jury noted that such content remains at risk. The presentation of data to a court or prosecuting authority, or the publication through news media, implies the introduction of a long-term preservation function. The 2021 Jury agreed with this assessment and Endangered classification but changed the 2021 trend towards greater risk in light of recent developments in crowd-sourced investigations and fact-checking. The 2022 Taskforce agreed on a trend towards even greater risk based on the increased significance of crowd-sourced investigations and fact-checking in light of ongoing global conflicts that include (but are not limited to) those in Ukraine.

The 2023 Council agreed with the Endangered classification with the overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend), noting that some of the description and language used in the entry may be confusing. For example, one might think if investigations are complete that surely the parts used as evidence or published in articles are captured elsewhere and presumably preserved there? While this may be the case, presuming long term preservation may lead to future loss in instances where this is not true. Here, risks can overlap with those found in 'Evidence in Court' and 'Proceedings in Court' entries, which themselves indicate that standard records management processes within designated agencies should be able to take care of the preservation of materials like this but, given that it is likely to involve complex types of data, such agencies may not be equipped to deliver preservation effectively.

The 2023 Council additionally recommended further scoping of the entry with input from those working with these materials directly, to help explain the unique challenges as well as examples where content has been lost due to deletion by social media companies and/or legal retention periods where certain content may not fall under the scope of records for long-term or permanent retention.

**2024 Interim Review**

These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).

The Council noted the work by the Syrian Archive, WITNESS, Data Cívica, Amnesty International’s Citizen Evidence Lab, the Human Rights Data Analysis Group, Mnemonic and UC Berkeley Human Rights Center potentially contributes specific preservation strategies and technologies for open source intelligence.
