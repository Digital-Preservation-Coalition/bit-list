title: Non-current Portable Solid State Media
description: "Materials saved to flash or other solid-state storage devices
  where the media is out of warranty and reader devices may no longer be
  supported or integrated easily into hardware infrastructure: typically, more
  than five years old."
examples: USB sticks and pen drives; Flash storage in cameras and phones;
  certain types of portable hard disk.

    classification: critically-endangered
hazards: Poor physical storage; inability to access readers; no replication;
  encryption; uncertainty over IPR or the presence of orphaned works.
mitigations: Active management; dependable access to readers; strong
  documentation; documentation independent from the media.

comments: >-
  An additional preservation risk here is that many libraries/archives use this
  media as the access copy as well as the preservation copy, thus increasing the
  risk of the data being overwritten, lost by mishandling as well as general
  bitrot and degradation. To decrease the risk, data should be transferred into
  a digital preservation system that allows for active management.


  Early generations of media and cheap giveaways are not robust and can deteriorate significantly over time.

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2019 to ensure that the range of media storage is properly assessed and presented. The 2019 Jury noted solid state media – typically flash – provides very fast access to data but can fail without warning. This is because it is typically subject to a limited number of program/erase cycles, as well as ‘read/disturb’ effects. Storage at scale also means the percentage likelihood of failure increases. The 2021 Jury and 2022 Taskforce agreed with the entry’s assigned risk classification with no noted changes towards increased or reduced risk.

The 2023 Council agreed with the continued risk classification of Critically Endangered with the overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend). They noted that many libraries, archives and other organizations are using these media as the access copy as well as the preservation copy. The data can be overwritten or lost by mishandling as well as bitrot and degradation. Data should be transferred into a digital preservation system that allows for active management.

**2024 Interim Review**

These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
