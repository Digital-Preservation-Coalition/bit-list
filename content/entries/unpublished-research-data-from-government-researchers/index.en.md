title: Unpublished Research Data from Government Researchers
description: Data sets and research outputs produced in the course of government
  research but never shared or made available outside of the initial research.
  In particular, the risk classification applies to research data under
  government embargo, restrictions due to sensitivities, classification issues,
  and/or materials suppressed for ideological reasons.
examples: Data sets or research outputs produced for agencies that have closed
  or have had funding withdrawn from research initiatives; research data from
  government agencies no longer active
categories:
  - Research Outputs
threats:
  - Out of Band
classification: critically-endangered
imminence: 4
effort: 4
trends:
  - year: 2023
    trend: no-change
    classification: critically-endangered
  - year: 2024
    trend: no-change
    classification: critically-endangered
hazards: Lack of access to archival services; sudden or unanticipated closure;
  loss of implicit knowledge from destabilized or demoralized staff; encryption;
  uncertainty over IPR or the presence of orphaned works
mitigations: Archival responsibility well developed; documentation; published
  through research channels
year-added: 2019
published: 2019-11-07
last-updated: 2024-11-07
aliases:

comments: The US made the news as part of the last government, but this is
  probably an issue in other countries as well and is, therefore, a category
  that could be made more generic. One question to ask is whether the research
  data is considered of long-term value or considered ephemeral?

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2019 under ‘Unpublished Research Data from US Government Researchers’. It has significant overlaps with other entries in the research outputs group but was set as a standalone entry to draw attention to two realities: 1. Research outputs are not simply a matter for academic institutions, and that government is, in fact, a major producer of research data; and 2. Political instability and threats to the continuity of government services are a significant preservation risk. The 2019 Jury noted that while it specifically related to the US government context, it did not mean that other jurisdictions are immune from political instability, and commented that politically inconvenient research outputs face particular and immediate threats of which the digital preservation community should be cognizant. No 2020 trend towards increased or decreased risk was identified. The 2021 Jury agreed with concerns raised by the 2019 assessment but recommended the broader applicability should be more explicit. The entry title and description were changed to broaden and include governments across national and international contexts. The 2021 Jury added that with the changes, the risk profile will range and depend on the political system, the political change and the measures in place to save and reuse data from disbanded research projects; in other words, there may be instances where the unpublished research data in one country may fall under the Vulnerable classification. The 2022 Taskforce agreed with this 2021 assessment with no change to trend.

The 2023 Council agreed with the Critically Endangered classification with risks on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend) and recommended inviting additional review from an expert in this area for the next review. A further recommendation was made to consider whether it should be an individual entry or instead be incorporated as an example under the ‘Unpublished Research Data’ entry.

**2024 Interim Review**

These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
