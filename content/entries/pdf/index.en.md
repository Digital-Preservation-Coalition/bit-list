  including reports, agenda, minutes, correspondence, contracts, essays,

    classification: vulnerable
hazards: Lack of skills, commitment or policy from corporate owners; loss of
  context; loss of authenticity or integrity; external dependencies; poor
  storage; lack of understanding; significant diversity of data; poorly
  developed digitization specifications; lack of integrity checking; poorly
  developed migration or normalizations specifications; lack of virus control;
  poor storage or replication; lack of validation at the point of creation;
  encryption; uncertainty over IPR or the presence of orphaned works.
mitigations: Well-managed data infrastructure; preservation planning;
  authenticity managed; use of persistent identifiers; reduction of
  dependencies; application of records management standards; recognition of
  preservation requirements beyond formats; strategic investment in digital
  preservation; preservation roadmap; clear licensing to enable digital
  preservation and deposit in a trusted archive; participation in digital
  preservation community; format validation; version control.

  There is a lot of material produced and kept in PDF. Some of it is
  authoritative, in other words, the only available copy, while some of it is
  not. However, if it is the only copy and it is lost, it can have an impact on
  a lot of people


  The challenge in evaluating the significance and impact of the loss of PDFs is that they’re quite often a surrogate of something else, whether a digitized record or a Word document, etc. Whether or not that record is retained may be a factor. We should also be considering PDF Portfolios, which are an extension of PDF 1.7. Portfolios contain embedded files and can include text documents, spreadsheets, PowerPoints, emails, Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings.


  Vulnerability also depends on if the PDF file conforms to the specific PDF/A standard or not. This is caused by a combination of 1) not conforming to the standard and 2) collection managers assuming that the file is resilient simply because it purports to be a PDF/A. This risk is less with the format and more with the understanding and experience in data management. Moreover, materials embedded in or attached to PDF/A-2 and PDF/A-3 may be at risk.

**2023 Review**

A PDF entry was added in 2017 and was split into two entries, ‘PDF/A’ and ‘PDF other than PDF/A’, in 2019 to emphasize the different threats faced by different types of PDF. The 2021 Jury agreed with this decision and noted that trends for the PDF other than PDF/A entry and the PDF/A entry were both towards a reduced risk. The 2022 Taskforce agreed these risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).

The 2023 Council recommended merging the two previously split entries of ‘PDF/A’ and ‘PDF other than PDF/A’. After reviewing the two entries separately, they found more similarities than differences between the two and, indeed, across all types of PDF (not just PDF/A). Due to the level of commercial, open-source tools that are available to assist preservation, the risk of loss was less persistent than previously suggested. Therefore, a Vulnerable classification was assigned as the most appropriate for all PDF formats as a whole.

**2024 Interim Review**

The 2024 Council agreed these risks remain on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend).
