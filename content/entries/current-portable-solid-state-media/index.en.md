comments: This entry is highly dependent on who is looking after the portable
  media but made more difficult over time. The lack of granularity in the
  definition means that only general advice can be offered, such as to refresh
  media. In time, it may yet be more useful to split all storage media (maybe
  100 items long) with an indication of how long these can be expected to last.
  In many cases, specialists can recover obsolete media, but the cost of
  employing them can become an aggravating condition.

**2023 Review**

The 2019 Jury introduced this entry to ensure that the range of media storage is properly assessed and presented. The 2020 and 2021 Juries, and 2022 Taskforce, agreed with the entry’s assigned risk classification with no noted changes towards increased or reduced risk (no change to trend).

The 2023 Council agreed with the risk classification of Endangered with the overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend).

**2024 Interim Review**

The 2024 Council agreed these risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
