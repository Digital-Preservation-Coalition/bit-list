title: Email
description: Documents, correspondence and other records created in the course
  of contractual dealings between individuals and agencies, especially where the
  subjects are of long duration and may be subject to legal scrutiny at
  undefined points in the distant future.
examples: Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo Mail, Outlook, and email in all its forms
  including individual messages, threads of conversation, mailboxes, email
  servers and file attachments.

    trend: no-change
    classification: endangered
hazards: Lack of skills, commitment or policy from corporate owners; uncertainty
  or conflicting claims over IPR or orphaned works; use of personal accounts for
  professional work and vice versa; proliferation and duplication of
  attachments; email not recognized as a record; absent, unworkable or
  inconsistent records management; dependence on free cloud-based services; lack
  of migration path; lack of preservation planning; perverse incentives to
  delete; encryption.
mitigations: Application of appraisal and selection tools; timely transfer to
  preservation facility or archive; commitment to transparency; preservation
  policy; working preservation plan; clear migration path; widespread
  recognition of email as a record.

comments: Email is hugely important as it has been so pervasive as a
  communication mechanism for society. Some methods used and responsibility
  adopted for collecting at the business and public body level (again will
  differ globally), but this will be a fraction of the communities that use it,
  and few will be set up for the long-term care of this data.

      characteristics and optimal functional requirements of email messages and

This entry was added in 2017, but the Jury did not have the capacity to assess it in detail. It was reviewed and assessed in 2019, including highlights to significant developments, including the recommendations of the Email Preservation Taskforce and the development of the ePADD software. Email presents many preservation challenges, from scale through core technologies, attachments, privacy and intellectual property rights. Because this entry intersects with many others, the aggravating conditions associated with email should be considered in conjunction where relevant. The 2021 Jury agreed with the *Endangered* classification with an identified trend toward reduced risk. The 2021 trend was based on discussions on continued developments in email preservation tools and techniques, as well as the growing number of archives preserving email content while recognizing issues with providing access to preserved email content. They added that ongoing records management policies towards corporate or business email need to be better embedded to stop the loss of important email content, and more awareness is needed around the potential of personal email. While record-keeping legislation and mandates direct retention periods, email document decisions taken by government officials at local, regional and national levels are not always well maintained, if at all; a loss could impact people’s lives along with their ability to assert rights. The 2022 Taskforce agreed on a trend towards reduced risk based on material improvement with applied examples of good practice, including (but not limited to) approaches to creating a PDF format for the preservation of email, and improvements to existing software, tools and workflows supporting complex email preservation.

The 2023 Council agreed with the *Endangered* classification, with risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to the 2023 trend). However, they also noted a decrease in the imminence of action and effort to preserve. The Council also recommended noting areas of overlap with the ‘Cloud-based Services and Communications Platforms’ entry as it pertains to the saving and preservation of email in cloud-based services such as Microsoft Sharepoint.

The 2024 interim review concluded that these risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend). They agree with the Endangered classification, with the potential for new initiatives around a profile of PDF specifically for email archiving coming later in 2024, and how this could impact the community.
