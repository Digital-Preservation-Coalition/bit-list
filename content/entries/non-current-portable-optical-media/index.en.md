comments: |-
  We know what to do; it is the scale of the problem. It is a big scale problem - and in many library catalogues the information about these carriers and their playing requirements do not exist in metadata. Big scale surveys of collections to identify these carriers might be a barrier to starting to tackle this one.

  Optical media is less and less recoverable as time goes on. The data cannot be actively managed, the readers are starting to go out of style, and the carriers will continue to rapidly degrade. Early generations of this media are not as robust as the current generation and can deteriorate significantly if not stored appropriately. Many optical media that were created by individuals using consumer-grade hardware and software are more vulnerable than media created using commercial-grade production techniques, and often user error makes the data unreadable before bitrot and other degradation is able to begin. The presence of adhesive labels can be a big warning sign of this type of vulnerability.

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2019 to ensure that the range of media storage is properly assessed and presented. The 2019 Jury noted optical media is, in some senses, a preferred option as it is typically more stable than magnetic or solid state media, but these characteristics have been oversold. The substrates of the disks can prove unstable, and more importantly, the reader technology tends to be proprietary and can become obsolete long before the disks degrade. Storage at scale also means the percentage likelihood of failure increases. The 2021 Jury and 2022 Taskforce agreed with the entry’s assigned risk classification with no noted changes towards increased or reduced risk.

The 2023 Council agreed with the risk classification of Critically Endangered with the overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend).

**2024 Interim Review**

The 2024 Council agreed These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
