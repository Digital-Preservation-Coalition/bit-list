title: Games with Online Play Components
description: Video games with online components that have online elements for
  interactive aspects of play, in particular those with online multiplayer
  components. This does not exclude games that have both online multiplayer and
  offline single player components (e.g., Dark Souls has online multiplayer
  components but also has the ability for single player play in offline mode)
  but rather the focus on the entry is on the online components for interactive
  play and there is more potential to preserve the interaction. This excludes
  games that are no longer available legally.
examples: Dark Souls, Minecraft, Portal 2, Stardew Valley, Super Mario Bros. Wonder.

classification: critically-endangered
imminence: 3
effort: 3
hazards: Lack of skills, commitment or policy from corporate owners; always
  online DRM; uncertainty over IPR or the presence of orphaned works; lack of
  offline backup; changing business model of providers; limited recognition of
  value of game play; over dependence on goodwill of ad-hoc community;
  dependency on bespoke hardware or interfaces; Complex hardware dependencies or
  bespoke hardware
mitigations: Emulation pathway; source code; trusted repository; large user
  community; IPR supportive of preservation; strong documentation

comments: Whilst this entry focuses on games with online play components that
  are still accessible (any servers that have been shut down or discontinued
  would fall into the Shut Down or Discontinued Video Games entry), these games
  could potentially lose server support thus necessitating urgent action to
  preserve the online component whilst the server is still active. A recent
  example of this is the announcement in October 2023 of Nintendo discontinuing
  online services for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software from early April 2024.
  Whilst the offline component will still be accessible, the game will have lost
  features and/or game modes that use online components thus changing the nature
  of the game.

      aim of building a collection of significant 1990s Australian videogames
      for the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI), preserving these
      and evaluating relevant emulation platforms, including EaaSI to determine
      their efficacy for accessing born digital artefacts."

**2023 Review**

This entry, alongside the Games with ‘Offline Play Components’ entry, was created from rescoping the previous ‘Old or Non-current Video Games’ entry as part of the 2023 Bit List review. It was rescoped to highlight the differences in preserving online components as opposed to offline components in video games, specifically the dependency of servers.

**2024 Interim Review**

The 2024 Council agreed These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
