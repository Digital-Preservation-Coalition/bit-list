title: Games with Offline Play Components
description: This entry is focused on games that can be played offline, often
  those designed for single player play while in offline mode. This does not
  exclude games that can be played online or have online interactive components
  (e.g., Sims 3 can be played online or offline), but rather the focus is on the
  preservation of offline single player components over the online components.
examples: "Sims 3, Planescape: Torment, Hades, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"

hazards: Lack of skills, commitment or policy from corporate owners; complex
  hardware dependencies or bespoke hardware; dependence on obsolete, low usage
  operating systems with no emulation pathway; uncertainty over IPR or the
  presence of orphaned works; use of older magnetic media; loss of underlying
  code or gaming engine
mitigations: Emulation pathway; source code; trusted repository; large user
  community; IPR supportive of preservation; strong documentation

comments: >-
  Whilst this has the same risk classification as the Games with Online Play
  Components entry, the risk could be considered to be slightly lesser due to
  the lack of reliance on servers as well as examples of games having their
  online services shut down but players still being able to access the offline
  game modes/features, such as the case with Nintendo discontinuing online
  services for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software in early April 2024 where they
  explicitly state that “Players will still be able to use features and game
  modes that do not require online communication”.


  This entry is also interlinked with the entries covering games played on different hardware (Console games, PC games and smartphone games entries) as the risks can change based on this

    comment: "The Play It Again: Preserving Australian Videogame History of the
      1990s (Play It Again 2) project, which builds on the original Play It
      Again project focused on curating a collection of Australasian games of
      the 1980s. This second iteration of Play It Again was assembled with the
      aim of building a collection of significant 1990s Australian videogames
      for the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI), preserving these
      and evaluating relevant emulation platforms, including EaaSI to determine
      their efficacy for accessing born digital artefacts."

**2023 Review**

This entry, alongside the ‘Games with Online Play Components’ entry, was created from rescoping the previous ‘Old or Non-current Video Games’ entry as part of the 2023 Bit List review. It was rescoped to highlight the differences in preserving offline components as opposed to online components in video games, specifically a lack of dependence on servers.

**2024 Interim Review**

The 2024 Council agreed these risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
