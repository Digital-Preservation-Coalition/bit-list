title: Media Art by Deceased Artists or Defunct Workshops
description: Media art where the artists or creative technicians are either
  deceased or not able to provide guidance on authenticity and installation.
examples: "Works produced by media artists now deceased, such as: Jeremy Blake,
  Beatriz Da Costa, Heiko Daxl or Stanislaus Ostoja-Kotkowski"
categories:
  - Media Art
threats:
  - Complexity Limitations
classification: critically-endangered
imminence: 3
effort: 3
trends:
  - year: 2023
    trend: no-change
    classification: critically-endangered
  - year: 2024
    trend: no-change
    classification: critically-endangered
hazards: Lack of documentation to enable maintenance; uncertainty over IPR or
  the presence of orphaned works; complex interdependencies on specific
  hardware, software or operating systems; lack of capacity in the gallery or
  workshop; lack of strategic investment; complex external dependencies; loss of
  institutional memory resulting from staff churn; poor working relationship
  between the gallery and artist/workshop; lack of conservation assessment
mitigations: Strong documentation; clarity of preservation path and ensuing
  responsibilities; proven preservation plan; capacity of workshop to support
  re-installation; capacity of gallery to conserve; capacity of gallery to
  re-install; retention of institutional memory including archives of
  correspondence between gallery and artist/workshop; strong and continuing
  working relationship between the gallery and artist/workshop; regular
  conservation assessment

  This entry includes a point in the lifecycle of all media art, so good
  practice recommendations are likely to become more important over time.
  Preservation issues may not become visible until the piece is brought out of
  storage for loan or exhibition, underscoring the value of continuous or
  periodic conservation assessment. The range of data/formats/hardware/software
  etc. can be new and varied, providing organizations with an ongoing technical
  challenge that they are not initially equipped to deal with. Some loss seems
  inevitable.


  Preservation of legacy media artworks is dependent on access to obsolete technology and also the knowledge of how to operate said technology. Documentation around the production process and artist intent can be limited and more critical without any access to artists or technicians. This creates risk around the preservation of a truly authentic artwork..

    comment: The DPC ‘Preserving Digital Art’ Technology Watch Guidance Note is
      aimed at institutions starting to collect digital art as part of a wider
      collecting remit. It offers basic guidance on the specificities of digital
      art and how it may differ from other digital content in an institution’s
      care.

      project ‘Infrastructure sustainable accessibility digital art’ invests in
      research, training, knowledge sharing and conservation to prevent the loss
      of both digital artworks and the knowledge to preserve them.

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2019 as a subset of the 2017 ‘Media Art,’ which was first introduced with particular reference to historical media art, but split by the 2019 Jury to ensure greater specificity in its recommendation. This entry represents works held in galleries where the artist is deceased or the workshop has closed, and there is limited prospect to obtain new documentation. The 2020 Jury found a trend towards greater risk based on how galleries, which often rely on visitors for income, have been closed for extended periods and circumstances of economic dislocation. The 2021 Jury agreed on a continued trend towards greater risk based on the increasing risk of this loss happening with more time sensitivity for early media artworks.

The 2023 Council agreed with the *Critically Endangered* classification with overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend).

**2024 Interim Review**

These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend). However, they add that it is important to bring attention to the key element and importance of providing guidance on authenticity and installation. Emulation tools are helping but the missing guidance on authenticity increases the risk.
