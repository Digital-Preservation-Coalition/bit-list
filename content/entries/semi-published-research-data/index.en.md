title: Semi-Published Research Data
description: Data sets produced in the course of research and shared between
  researchers, such as by posting to a website or portal but without
  preservation capability or commitment. Typically the data remains in the hands
  of the researchers who have the job of maintaining it.
examples: Departmental web servers; project wikis; GitHub repositories
categories:
  - Research Outputs
threats:
  - Out of Band
classification: endangered
imminence: 3

trends:
  - year: 2023
    trend: no-change
    classification: endangered

    trend: no-change
    classification: endangered
hazards: Originating researcher no longer active or changed research focus;
  staff on temporary contracts; dependence on single student or staff member;
  weak or fluid institutional commitment to subject matter; weak institutional
  commitment to data sharing; uncertainty over IPR or the presence of orphaned
  works; encryption; limited or dysfunctional data management planning; web
  capture challenges that means unlikely to be picked up by automatic crawlers
mitigations: Data in preparation for transfer to specialist repository; robust
  data management planning; documented and managed professionally using data

comments: >-
  There is a positive trend of increased research data management activity and
  engagement by libraries and data centres, which should help to ensure that
  more research datasets are properly deposited in data repositories, rather
  than left in a 'semi-published' state.


  Offering and minting researchers Digital Object Identifiers for datasets deposited at specialist repositories will encourage data citation and increase research impact of individual researchers, which traditionally relied more on publishing papers than datasets.

**2023 Review**

This 2019 entry was previously introduced in 2017 under ‘Research Data,’ though without explicit reference to semi-published research data. The 2019 Jury split the ‘Research Data’ entry into a range of contexts for research outputs, including this addition. The entry draws attention to represent ‘self-help’ data sharing which is to be encouraged as a means to facilitate open science but should not be confused with long-term preservation. The 2021 Jury agreed with the Endangered classification, noting problems with the volume of data being produced but not being kept in a meaningful way. They noted that research data is complex and has specific requirements for documentation that may only be known to subject matter experts; however, data creators (e.g., researchers) are not necessarily well placed to sustain the data in the long term.

There were also a few significant changes to the entry in the 2021 Bit List.

Removal of ‘informally’ from the previous entry description (‘shared informally between researchers’) due to possible misperception or misunderstanding; ‘informal’ may imply researchers would perceive the data as low value and not want it captured. This may be the case, so it is important to consider and provide advice to researchers who think there is value in their data.

Two previous entries (Geomagnetic Data and Software and Maritime Archaeological Archives) have been removed as separate entries and incorporated into this broader entry on semi-published research data to highlight the range of content and forms semi-research data can take and highlight the need for specialized knowledge and specialist repositories for preparing and managing the data throughout the lifecycle

The 2021 trend towards reduced risk, which was based on improvements and initiatives towards the preservation of semi-published research data since the entry’s addition in 2019.

The 2022 Taskforce agreed on a trend towards reduced risk based on material improvement over the last year which had not only offered examples of good research data management and preservation practices but also suggested a significant shift towards a culture of change and collaboration across different research communities and stakeholders. Those mentioned included (but were not limited to) improvements and initiatives by the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), Science Europe, Research Data Alliance (RDA), Digital Curation Centre (DCC) and related projects on the preservation of research data and outputs.

The 2023 Council agreed with the Endangered classification and that risk remained on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend).

**2024 Interim Review**

These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
