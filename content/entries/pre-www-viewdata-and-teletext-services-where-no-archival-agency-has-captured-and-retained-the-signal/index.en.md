comments: "From a cultural studies point of view, it is a huge loss: an
  important source of information about news and social mores of the time. Is
  there progress to report on this entry, meaning that elements of the problem
  have been resolved? Major national agencies have collections of off-air
  recorded television on videotape carriers, which are likely to contain the
  teletext data. Few, if any, have undertaken substantial extraction and
  preservation of the teletext in its own right. However, many have digitized
  videotape carriers to digital file formats, which are now under preservation.
  An active Teletext enthusiast community has developed and created programmatic
  solutions to extract the teletext from the video files and emulation of the
  teletext display. A next step could be a collaboration between the official
  agencies and the enthusiast community to develop a systematic programme to
  extract teletext from off-air recordings for both preservation and access via
  emulation."

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2017, with a number of important developments reported since, raising hope that collections can be recovered and reused under certain circumstances. In particular, the development and on live capture of broadcast output at the BBC and British Film Institute noted by 2018 and 2019 Bit List Juries. Embedded signals can be assembled to access the Teletext content, and methods to recover such signals have been demonstrated (where the appropriate broadcast archive exists). In 2019, a proposal to add teletext graphics characters to the Universal Coded Character Set was also accepted, making it easier to transmit and archive teletext and legacy computer graphics for archiving and preservation. Version 13.0 of the Unicode Standard, released in March 2020, included the addition of graphic characters that provide compatibility with early teletext broadcasting standards. For these reasons, the 2020 Jury identified a 2020 trend towards reduced risk. The 2021 Jury identified a 2021 trend toward more reduced risk. They noted that while not yet fully clear how such a signal could be made searchable or made available at scale, research had progressed with different threads of research and enthusiast and community-led initiatives being brought together in the development of preservation tools and techniques. In light of those these developments and active research and recovery efforts, the 2021 Jury additionally supported a change from the Practically Extinct to Critically Endangered classification. The 2022 Taskforce agreed on the classification with risks remaining on the same basis as before, with no change to the trend.

The 2023 Council noted there may be a lower significance of the digital material of this entry than the previous 2021 Jury but agreed with the Critically Endangered classification with overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend).

**2024 Interim Review**

These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
