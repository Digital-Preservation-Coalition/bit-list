title: Open Source Intelligence Sources of Current Conflicts
description: Open source intelligence produced, collected and analysed from
  publicly, openly available social media and web content with the purpose of
  answering a specific intelligence question and that supports crowd-sourced
  investigation and fact-checking to verify or refute claims of state agencies
  and rebel groups in the context of current political or military conflict.
examples: Social media sources relating to current conflicts, such as in Yemen or Syria

  inadvertently in other ways - but is ambiguous about who has ultimate
  responsibility for collecting and preserving this.

    comment: The Ukraine Investigations by GLAN and Bellingcat Justice &
      Accountability project to investigate alleged atrocity crimes taking place
      in Ukraine. The aim of the project is to conduct a set of open source
      investigations into incidents causing civilian harm occurring in Ukraine
      according to robust legal standards with the aim of making them available
      to national and international prosecutors who are gathering evidence of
      alleged crimes. In this case, the open source content gathered during
      Bellingcat’s investigations will be preserved by Mnemonic, an independent
      third-party organization maintaining an archive of digital content from
      Ukraine, as it has done for Syria, Yemen and Sudan.

**2023 Review**

This entry was added as a subset in 2019, as part of a broader ‘Open Source Intelligence Sources’ which the Jury split into three elements, relating to current, recent and historic sources. This entry relates in particular to materials relating to current and ongoing conflicts. Social media companies have a policy to take down or suppress content that they consider to be propaganda for terrorist groups. This has had the unintended consequence of deleting or suppressing content that was being used in open source investigation or fact-checking for journalistic or judicial purposes, and which may therefore be an impediment to refutation or prosecution. However, a new generation of cloud-based services, such as Hunchly, have emerged in the last few years, which allow investigators to copy and stabilize content to private accounts in the process of investigating it: so, the ethical requirements of social media companies and the integrity of the investigation are both served. The 2021 Jury noted that such content stays at risk, and the process of investigation is slower than algorithmic deletion. Nonetheless, there is a notable difference in the investigation of current conflicts than historic ones where evidence has been lost. The 2022 Taskforce identified a trend towards even greater risk based on the increased significance of crowd-sourced investigations and fact-checking in light of ongoing global conflicts that include (but are not limited to) those in Ukraine.

The 2023 Council agreed with the Critically Endangered classification with the overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend). The 2023 Council also added clarification to the meaning of ‘open source’ for this entry, to explain its meaning in relation to intelligence openly available online, noting that open source can also refer to a specific software or content licence that permits limited uses of IP so this distinction would be helpful for readers. 

**2024 Interim Review**

These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).

The Council acknowledge the continuing challenge of ensuring the preservation of complete and accurate resources given that: platform owners continue to be obliged to remove content that violates community standards;  copyright and ownership increasingly hinders capture/preservation of the open source materials; and with the rise in fakes, preservationists must attend to standards for legal admissibility and authentication which vary from one jurisdiction to another.
