title: Legacy Media Art
description: Media art in storage or not otherwise displayed but where the
  artists or technicians are available to support installation.
examples: Media art in storage
categories:
  - Media Art
threats:
  - Complexity Limitations
classification: endangered
imminence: 3
effort: 2
trends:
  - year: 2023
    trend: no-change
    classification: endangered
  - year: 2024
    trend: no-change
    classification: endangered
hazards: Lack of documentation to enable maintenance; uncertainty over IPR or
  the presence of orphaned works; complex interdependencies on specific
  hardware, software or operating systems; lack of capacity in the gallery or
  workshop; lack of strategic investment; complex external dependencies; loss of
  institutional memory resulting from staff churn; poor working relationship
  between the gallery and artist/workshop; lack of conservation assessment
mitigations: Strong documentation; clarity of preservation path and ensuing
  responsibilities; proven preservation plan; capacity of workshop to support
  re-installation; capacity of gallery to conserve; capacity of gallery to
  re-install; retention of institutional memory including archives of
  correspondence between gallery and artist/workshop; strong and continuing
  working relationship between the gallery and artist/workshop; regular
  conservation assessment

  This entry attempts to capture a point in the lifecycle of media art where
  preservation risks are increasing but not yet critical. There is a risk that
  preservation issues will not become apparent until the piece is brought out of
  storage when considered for loan or exhibition – often on timescales that make
  it too late to address preservation concerns effectively. Galleries should be
  aware that the range of data/formats/hardware/software embedded in media art
  can be wide and vary at different speeds.


  Sooner action is needed to prevent the material from becoming *Critically Endangered* once the artist has died or relationships break down. Where the artist is still around, there is a major reduction in the inevitability of loss and its potential to be a potentially newsworthy subject. The loss of it would be just as impactful and significant though.


  Preservation of legacy media artworks is dependent on access to obsolete technology and also the knowledge of how to operate said technology. Documentation around the production process and artist intent can be limited. This is a risk in terms of preserving a truly authentic artwork.

    comment: The DPC ‘Preserving Digital Art’ Technology Watch Guidance Note is
      aimed at institutions starting to collect digital art as part of a wider
      collecting remit. It offers basic guidance on the specificities of digital
      art and how it may differ from other digital content in an institution’s
      care.

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2017 as ‘Media Art,’ which was first introduced with particular reference to historical media art. The 2019 Jury rescoped this entry to ensure greater specificity in its recommendation to represent works held in galleries but no longer displayed, but where there is a continuing working relationship between the gallery and the artist or workshop and reasonable expectation that support for preservation could still be obtained when required. The 2020 Jury identified a trend towards greater risk, given that many museums and galleries, which often rely on visitors for income, had been closed for extended periods. Moreover, any form of digital materials that rely on an individual’s knowledge is at particular risk by a pandemic. For similar reasons, the 2021 Jury also identified a 2021 trend towards greater risk, noting that digital materials in museums and galleries records are likely to be at greater risk in these circumstances.

The 2023 Council agreed with the *Endangered* classification with overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend), while also noting a decrease in imminence of action as well as the required effort to preserve.

**2024 Interim Review**

The 2024 Council agreed These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
