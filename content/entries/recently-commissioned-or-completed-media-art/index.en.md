title: Recently Commissioned or Completed Media Art
description: Media art currently displayed in a gallery or in the process of
  being displayed.
examples: Media art recently acquired by galleries that utilize specific
  hardware and software in order to be accessed or exhibited
categories:
  - Media Art
threats:
  - Complexity Limitations
classification: vulnerable
imminence: 4
effort: 2
trends:
  - year: 2023
    trend: no-change
    classification: vulnerable
  - year: 2024
    trend: no-change
    classification: vulnerable
hazards: Lack of documentation to enable maintenance; Uncertainty over IPR or
  the presence of orphaned works; complex interdependencies on specific
  hardware, software or operating systems; lack of capacity in the gallery or
  workshop; lack of strategic investment; complex external dependencies; lack of
  documentation about artist intent; lack of understanding of costs for display
  and preservation
mitigations: Strong documentation; clarity of preservation path and ensuing
  responsibilities; proven preservation plan; capacity of workshop to support
  artwork at de-installation; capacity of gallery to conserve after
  de-installation; capacity of gallery to re-install work; funding understood to
  re-install

  By the time digital art, time-based media, etc., has entered into the
  permanent care of a stewarding institution, many of its technologies are
  already end-of-life, unsupported, or the hardware components have
  deteriorated. Often the expertise to maintain these many interacting
  components sits outside the host organization, with a technical supplier to
  the gallery, and this is in itself vulnerable to business change. Although
  there are a few exceptions, there is a need for greater capacity within the
  museum and gallery sector to address the challenges.


  There have been new initiatives for guidance and examples of institutions taking wider sectoral responsibility for standards, which have helped with the effort to preserve, such as Matters in Media Art information resource and guidance.


  Media artworks are often made with a network of knowledge that can be precarious. Documentation around production processes can be minimal, and hence acting quickly with known processes can gather information before the knowledge and people networks start to disperse. This can mean preservation of production environments and associated workflows can be preserved alongside the media.


  Some art works specifically leverage the limitations and characteristics of the systems that they incorporate, often in unusual ways. This can be hard to migrate or emulate accurately.

    comment: The DPC ‘Preserving Digital Art’ Technology Watch Guidance Note is
      aimed at institutions starting to collect digital art as part of a wider
      collecting remit. It offers basic guidance on the specificities of digital
      art and how it may differ from other digital content in an institution’s
      care.

      Media Arts in V4, initiated by the Olomouc Museum of Art as a joint
      international platform for sharing experience with building and
      maintaining collections of new media artworks across different types of
      institutions. The aim of the project is to find workable methods for
      heritage institutions to build and maintain collections of media arts,
      which are necessary for safeguarding this area for the benefit of

    comment: The Collaborative Infrastructure for sustainable access to digital art
      LIMA project, to prevent the loss of digital artworks and to commonly
      develop the knowledge to preserve these works in a sustainable way. The
      project ‘Infrastructure sustainable accessibility digital art’ invests in
      research, training, knowledge sharing and conservation to prevent the loss
      of both digital artworks and the knowledge to preserve them.

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2019 as a separate entry, but it was previously introduced in 2017 under ‘Media Art’ with particular reference to historical media art. It was added for greater specificity for its recommendations, to represent works acquired and commissioned in the last five years where there is a reasonable expectation that documentation has been produced or could still be obtained. While the 2020 Jury found no change in trend, the 2021 Jury discussed how prospects for long-term preservation depend entirely on whether the artwork is collected post-commission and by an organization with the resources to care for it. They agreed that the classification remains Vulnerable but with a trend towards greater risk because the imminence of action is time-sensitive, requiring working with the artist to get the documentation from them about their work and what is needed before it is too late. Furthermore, there remains a vulnerability for the smaller museums or others that do not take the preservation of media art as seriously.

The 2023 Council agreed with the Vulnerable classification with overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend), although noted a change in the imminence of action from 3 years to 12 months.

**2024 Interim Review**

The 2024 Council agreed These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend). However, it was important to note that the ‘Effort to Preserve | Inevitability’ can vary. Some of the works take a huge effort to preserve and that perhaps this needs some middle ground in terms of communicating those aspects.
