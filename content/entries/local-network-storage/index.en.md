  centers based on technologies such as (NAS) Network Attached Storage, (SAN)
  Storage Area Networks, Gluster FS and related.
categories:
  - Integrated Storage
threats:
  - Complex Platforms
classification: vulnerable
imminence: 2
effort: 1
trends:
  - year: 2023
    trend: no-change
    classification: vulnerable
  - year: 2024
    trend: no-change
    classification: vulnerable
hazards: Encryption; lack of routine maintenance; lack of storage replication;
  over-dependence on a single supplier, technology or technician; insufficient
  documentation; single point of failure; political or commercial interference;
  failure of dependencies (e.g., power supply, controller software); overly
  aggressive compression; poor information security; lack of integrity-checking;
  lack of strategic investment; lack of warranty; unenforceable warranty,
  encryption; Uncertainty over IPR or the presence of orphaned works.
mitigations: Backup to different technology; backup to diverse locations;
  documentation of assets; integrity checking; preservation planning;
  refreshment planning; export functionality; resilient to hacking; selection
  and appraisal criteria; version control; resilient funding; technology watch;
  enforceable warranty; disaster planning and documentation.

This entry was added in 2019 to ensure that the range of media storage is properly assessed and presented.

The 2023 Council agreed with the current *Vulnerable* classification with overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend), while also noting a slight decrease in the effort needed to preserve and the imminence of action required when compared to the 2021 Jury review.

The 2024 Council agreed These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
