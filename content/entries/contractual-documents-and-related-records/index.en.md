comments: |-
  Closer collaboration over the digital record lifecycle with recordkeeping organizations such as IRMS/ARA and digital preservation organizations would help to ensure best practice from (before) record creation to its long-term preservation and would help to identify any risks and bridge gaps ‘from the cradle to the grave’. Joining forces and resources will enable the community to raise awareness of the impact of best practices on the organizational governance and related efficiencies. 

  Managed appraisal of these documents and records would also aid in lowering the risk of this entry.

    comment: The work and outputs of the EDRMS Preservation Taskforce, such as the EDRMS Preservation Toolkit, may be helpful for guidance as many of these records will be held in EDRMS type systems.

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2019 as a subset of an entry introduced in 2017 for ‘Digital Legal Records and Evidence,’ which was split into four more discrete entries. There is overlap with Pension Mortgage and Insurance Records entry, but this entry addresses digital records with value over the long term that may not be immediately obvious at the point of creation.

The likelihood of liquidation, mergers or acquisitions means that these records are trending towards greater risk. There was a 2020 trend towards greater risk in light of the Covid Pandemic causing profound dislocation across the economy, placing many companies and agencies at financial risk. There was no identified trend for 2021 or 2022. While there are some noticeable improvements in record-keeping legislation and regulations and guidance to this area, with a growing number of agencies handling and advising on what needs to be kept and for how long, both the 2021 Jury and 2022 Taskforce agreed there remained room for improving how legal agreements are managed through records management standards and processes.

The 2023 Council agreed with the Endangered classification with the overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend).

**2024 Interim Review**

These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
