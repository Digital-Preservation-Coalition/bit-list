comments: |-
  Personal papers can provide insight into the lived experience of a wider range of people - archives of ‘everyday’ people are invaluable to social historians and personal archives of people with national/international significance complement institutional/public records.

  There is a strong overlap with community archives, except noting that responsibility is even more localized. There is room breaking the entry down further into a series of components to represent the complexity more effectively and present a more nuanced action plan.

  This matter needs awareness-raising. Education is needed, such as digital preservation as a survival skill for teenagers. Also, simple and cheap tools or pathways to preservation are needed.

  Education to the public is critical for advocacy - these are the societal records of the future! Though having said that, what has survived in hardcopy has largely been through luck, and the same thing I think will be the same for digital. The same issues exist with glass plate negatives, photographs and certain emulsions and even printed digital photographs, brittle paper, fading ink etc.

    comment: Such materials are increasingly moved into the cloud and the Google Photos case provides a good example.

**2023 Review**

This was introduced to the Bit List in 2017. Although research and advice on the preservation of personal records have been available for some time, outreach and training have not reached the audience, and there has been no material improvement in the risks faced by this category since 2017. It is reasonable to assume that the number of digital objects in this category has increased; thus, the consequences of loss have expanded but the 2021 Jury determined there had been no significant trend towards greater risk; content is being lost all the time despite digital materials that can easily be preserved with tools not widely available outside of institutions. Therefore, this is a public awareness campaign issue, and more tools need to be made easily available for people to be able to better preserve their own digital content.

The 2023 Council agreed with the Critically Endangered classification but noted that the definition for this entry did not mention the potential wider historical/research significance of some personal archives to collecting institutions and recommended rescoping the entry to make this clearer.

**2024 Interim Review**

These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
