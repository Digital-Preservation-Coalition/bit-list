title: Legacy Video Files
description: Video files in any format containing moving pictures and sound
  recordings, particularly those that are proprietary, contain or utilize
  encrypted Digital Rights Management (DRM) or carrier bound.
examples: STARDIVA; AVI; MOV; MKV; MP3; MP4; on DVD or other carriers.

classification: endangered
imminence: 3
effort: 3
trends:
  - year: 2023
    trend: no-change
    classification: endangered
  - year: 2024
    trend: no-change
    classification: endangered
hazards: Lack of replication; encryption; digital rights management; Uncertainty
  over IPR or the presence of orphaned works; proliferation of file formats;
  weak or non-existent technical documentation; lack of preservation capability
  or commitment; poorly managed or digitization processes or QA; reliance on
  encoding/decoding software; Uncertainty over IPR or the presence of orphaned
  works.
mitigations: Effective replication; normalization of file formats; strong
  technical documentation; preservation pathway; good descriptive cataloguing;
  clear licensing to enable preservation; trusted repository.

comments: There are simply too many formats and too many standards, but the
  FFMPEG project and its related tools have significantly mitigated the
  technical risk to most video files. This enables a practitioner to transform
  the vast majority of file formats to safer preservation formats while
  retaining significant properties. However, technical risk is only one of the
  factors. There needs to be institutional engagement with audio-visual data as
  a priority. The issue then becomes one of identifying the organizations
  responsible and, constrained by the cost to store video data, making effective
  selection decisions.
case-studies:
  - comment: The NSV-based STARDIVA storage format is a video format with multiple
      audio streams used in simultaneous translation session recording by
      agencies such as the UN. It is a proprietary format that is no longer
      supported, cannot be natively preserved and cannot be viewed correctly
      using standard video playback tools. As noted by the nominator, given its
      use by agencies such as the UN, the loss of this format would be a loss of
      an international record. The nominator added that by using MediaArea
      LeaveSD it can be partially normalized for preservation purposes.

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2019 under ‘Video files’ to emphasize the issues of video preservation that pertain to offline recording, whether from broadcast, film industry, institutional and private collections. The 2019 Jury noted the connections between this entry and others relating to social media but argued for a standalone to emphasize the range of issues tied to numerous formats and standards. The 2021 Jury discussed the need for further rescoping, arguing that the entry was too broad to be useful without specifying at-risk types or formats. For this reason, its scope was narrowed to legacy videos that are proprietary, encrypted or carrier-bound. The classification remained Endangered with a 2021 trend towards greater risk given the growing content of at-risk legacy video files but a limited mandate. The 2022 Taskforce noted no change to the trend (they agreed these risks remain on the same basis as before).

The 2023 Council agreed with the Endangered with the overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend). Additionally, they agreed that a submitted Bit List nomination for the NSV-based STARDIVA storage format would provide a good example of a video file format especially at risk due to aggravating conditions rather than a separate stand-alone entry.

**2024 Interim Review**

These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).

Council members in the Formats category group recommended further rescoping of overlaps, in particular to differences between formats and physical carries mentioned, which have different risks and issues. The listing of DVDs or other carriers, for example, may be better suited under the Portable Media category.
