hazards: Lack of skills, commitment or policy from corporate owners; uncertainty
  over IPR or the presence of orphaned works; controversies around IPR; lack of
  offline backup; changing business model of providers; limited recognition of
  value of game play; limited recognition of value of game preservation; over
  dependence on goodwill of ad-hoc community; lack of preservation know-how at

  reliance on always-on DRM for single player games
mitigations: Well documented code; IPR supportive of preservation; large and
  committed user community; removal of always-on DRM for single player games

  Preservation for Always Online games in a playable state requires preservation
  or re-creation of the servers that are used to run these games. Even then, for
  MMOs or multiplayer games, it would be impossible to recreate these games at
  their various peaks. This nicely encapsulates why video recordings of (online)
  gameplay are important. They will never have the same configuration of
  subscribers, to say nothing of the innumerable changes made to the software
  over the years, which have significantly altered how the game works and looks.
  Loss is inevitable, and it has already happened. The social and cultural
  aspects of play are incredibly important, and on-screen recording is the most
  robust way to capture that.




  Whilst it is expected that MMOs and always multiplayer games (such as Fortnite) would always require an internet connection due to their reliance on servers, single player games, or those where the primary gameplay is single player, being always online due to DRM provides an added risk to preservation. If the server shuts down, then even the single player components might not be playable, thus loss happens faster than a single player game that does not have a reliance on servers. For more details, see the ‘Shut Down or Discontinued Video Games’ entry.

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2019 as a subset of the 2017 entry for ‘gaming’. The 2020 and 2021 Juries noted a trend towards greater risk, due to the increased significance of these games during the COVID Pandemic as well as the evolving nature of MMOs, to the extent that the 2021 Jury changed the risk classification from Endangered to Critically Endangered.

The 2023 Council agreed with the 2022 Taskforce suggestion to consider the naming and scope of the entry, rescoping this entry to ‘Always Online Games’ covering all games that have to always be online, whether that is due to being MMOs, server-based games or single-player games with Always-Online DRM. Games that have online components but are not required to always be online fit into the new ‘Games with Online Play Components’ entry.

**2024 Interim Review**

The 2024 Council identified a trend towards even greater risk based on shifts in business models and increased litigation over the last year, resulting in more shutdowns which impact preservation efforts. It also raises time sensitivity for action; if there are no efforts to preserve and those existing are further shutdown, this raises the likelihood of loss.
