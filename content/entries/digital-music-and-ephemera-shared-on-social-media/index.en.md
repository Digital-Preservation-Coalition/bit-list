  The ephemera is increasingly stored on websites that themselves are fragile
  and are removed, and nothing held on these services can be relied on in
  archival timeframes.


  Web archiving and social media archiving have matured, so a representative sample is probably readily available for particular countries which are more mature in their digital preservation activities as opposed to other countries which are not.


  This entry also connects to other entries ‘Consumer Social Media Free at the Point of Use,’ ‘Data Posted to Defunct or Little-used Social Media Platforms’. There are similarities in regard to increased uncertainty around major social media sites, such as X (previously Twitter), and the preservation risks associated with underlying social media preservation which has an impact on the digital objects that fall under this entry, however this entry draws attention to additional risks associated with preservation of the digital forms and contexts in which these materials are shared and enjoyed.

    comment: The case of ‘Yahoo Groups’ closure serves to underline the fragility of
      community content hosted by third parties.

This entry was created in 2019 as a subset of a previous 2017 entry, ‘Digital Music Production and Sharing,’ which was split to draw attention to the different challenges faced by the different forms. While there are some overlaps with other entries relating to social media as well as those relating to community-generated content, it is a separate entry to emphasize the context in which music is shared and enjoyed; this context could be lost if attention were on products controlled by studios or artists. The 2020 Jury agreed that risks remained on the same basis as before, with no change to trend. The 2021 Jury discussed content increasingly being shared across multiple platforms, which is both good and bad for risk. A multi-platform nature provides an element of protection against total loss, but the role and type of interaction with the content on each platform are also important and expanding with limited attempts at preservation. For these reasons, the 2021 trend moved towards greater risk with the need for selective approaches based on the increasing volume of material. The 2022 Taskforce noted no change to the that trend (they agreed these risks remain on the same basis as before).

The 2023 Council agreed with the *Endangered* classification with the overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend).

The 2024 Council agreed that these risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
