title: 3D Digital Engineering Drawings
description: 3D digital engineering models produced as part of building or
  engineering design processes. The production of such drawings has progressed
  from a digital analogue of paper to complex digital environments such as BIM
  (Building Information Modelling) which combine original drawings, libraries of
  compound objects, and links to external data sets such as about the
  performance of materials and maintenance of parts.
examples: Building Information Management (BIM), Computer Aided Design (CAD),
  Product Data Management in engineering and architecture.

    classification: endangered
hazards: Lack of skills, commitment or policy from corporate owners; lack of
  preservation mandate or collecting institution; lack of preservation
  capability in data owner; irregularities in supply chains; complex or long
  data supply chains; dependencies on proprietary software or formats; lack of
  persistent identifiers; uncertainty over IPR or the presence of orphaned
  works; temporary joint-venture companies; poor records management; poor
  regulatory compliance; encryption.
mitigations: Well managed data infrastructure; preservation from the point
  creation; carefully managed IPR; persistent identifiers; well managed records
  management processes; recognition of preservation requirements at highest
  levels; strategic investment in digital preservation; host clearly identified;
  participation in the digital preservation community.

comments: Data in this category enables the safety and security of critical
  infrastructure, but the responsibility to maintain data is unclear, nor are
  retention periods clear. Although examples of good practice exist, the extent
  to which there are working solutions at large seems doubtful, and it is
  surprising that there are not more diverse success stories to report.

    comment: The Grenfell Tower Inquiry offers a case to consider how the loss of 3D
      Digital Engineering Drawings can have a huge impact, especially at the
      local level. For example, if Grenfell had been done using 3D technologies,
      do we have confidence that those materials would have been adequately
      preserved? What would have been the local impact? What would have been the
      impact on the inquiry?

      schedule due to different offices using different versions of the CATIA
      CAD/CAM software.

  - comment: The DPC Design and Construction Records technology watch report, which
      aims to support archival professionals as well as active designers and
      facilities managers, considering acquisition, preservation, and access
      approaches that account for both the technical and cultural components of
      the broad range of born-digital design and construction records created
      throughout the course of designing, building, and maintaining a built
      space. As well as bringing together a helpful summary of relevant work in
      this area and discussing a range of case studies it also covers the
      concept of visual digital literacy which is the first step towards
      understanding and managing this content.

**2023 Review**

This entry was first submitted in 2017 when the Jury lacked the capacity to consider it in detail. In 2019 it was assessed with additional expertise co-opted, with the decision to remain a very broad category, including major one-off construction and engineering projects, a long tail of more minor building programmes, and large volume but homogeneous production processes in engineering. The 2021 Jury agreed with its Endangered status with an identified 2021 trend towards greater risk. They noted the key consideration that the lifecycle of the products and the data that describes them vastly exceeds the short life cycles of the infrastructures on which they are designed. This challenge is compounded by supply chains that may involve many different stages of production, as well as the delivery of large projects through transitory joint venture companies that have no residual mechanism or capacity to preserve the data thereafter. Although there had been advancements in the development of new preservation tools and techniques for these materials, there were recent examples of the loss of 3D architectural drawings; those have had a huge impact, especially at the local level, as well as significant impacts on infrastructure, travel, and how people interact with built environments throughout the world. The 2022 Taskforce agreed these risks remained on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to the 2022 trend).

The 2023 Council agreed with the Endangered classification and seconded the trend reported last time; that risks continue on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to 2023 trend). Most of the complexities of the format and issues remained the same, such as reliance on proprietary software and complex or unknown copyrights with the datasets. Moving forward, it was highlighted by the Council that there needs to be a greater focus and understanding on the long-term preservation of these outputs within the sector.

**2024 Interim Review**

These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).

Additionally, some Council members pointed to where there may be overlaps with the Formats category, in particular in ways to further address Step, PDF/E, STL, 3DM, etc.
