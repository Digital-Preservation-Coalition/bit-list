title: Research Data Published through Repositories
description: Research data published through digital repositories or other
  services providers with specialist skills to manage the data and an ongoing
  commitment to ensure preservation.
examples: Recognized data repositories in specialist disciplines; institutional
  data repositories in subject specialist centres and partnerships.
categories:
  - Research Outputs

  - Out of Band
classification: vulnerable
imminence: 3

    trend: no-change
    classification: vulnerable
hazards: Lack of long-term commitment; lack of user community; lack of
  visibility to potential depositors; lack of institutional commitment;
  insufficient documentation; uncertainty over IPR or the presence of orphaned
  works
mitigations: Certification and documented good practice; effective documentation
  requirements for depositors; proven financial sustainability; skilled staff
  including professionalising disciplinary and general data stewardship offering
  a clear career option; participation in the digital preservation community;
  research data management training by repositories and research funders offered
  to depositors, in particular new career researchers

  A key consideration with this entry is whether the data repository is
  integrated with a preservation system to facilitate long term access and
  usability of datasets.


  The loss of tools, data or services within this group would impact on people and sectors around the world. Particularly those involved with reproducibility and those wishing to use the datasets for further research.


  Although there have been improvements in current practice, policies and workflows, there is still a significant corpus of information that was deposited before these improvements came into force. It is unlikely that there will be the time, will or resources to bring this information up to current standards.


  Creating additional preservation metadata to research data holdings may help render data more robust in the long term, where using a preservation system is not an option. With an emphasis on environmental sustainability, some repositories hesitate mandating additional copies of large datasets which may be in the region of hundreds of terabytes, as this adds to both storage cost and carbon footprint, especially when capturing and preserving the research methodology would enable recreating the dataset.

  - comment: A recent analysis from Martin Eve of CrossRef shows scholarly content
      at risk. The findings, based on the assessment of around 7.5 million of
      the e-books and articles for which CrossRef provides a fixed identifier or
      Digital Object Identifier, suggest that around a quarter of academic
      publications are not being preserved for the future. For c. 2 million
      articles in the study there were no evidence of them being preserved, and
      4.3 of works studied were preserved in at least one place.

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2019 as a separate entry, but it was previously introduced in 2017 under ‘Published research outputs,’ though without explicit reference to the capacity of the repository infrastructure. The 2019 Jury split the entry into a range of contexts for research outputs, including this addition classified as Vulnerable; the preservation of research data published through a well-founded repository with the capacity and commitment to ensure preservation and capability through their own professional development activities made it a lower risk outcome for research data. The 2021 Jury agreed with this classification but commented on the improvements and initiatives towards the preservation of research data and outputs, leading to a 2021 trend towards reduced risk. The 2022 Taskforce identified a 2022 trend towards reduced risk based on material improvement over the last year that had not only offered examples of good research data management and preservation practices but also suggested a significant shift towards a culture of change and collaboration across different research communities and stakeholders. Those mentioned included (but were not limited to) improvements and initiatives by the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), Science Europe, Research Data Alliance (RDA), Digital Curation Centre (DCC) and related projects on the preservation of research data and outputs.

The 2023 Council agreed with the Vulnerable classification and noted that there was a trend towards reduced risk due to increasing research data management and engagement activity by libraries, which should result in increasing amounts of datasets being deposited. The 2023 Council also noted it would be useful to see empirical data on depositing trends to assess this.

**2024 Interim Review**

These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
