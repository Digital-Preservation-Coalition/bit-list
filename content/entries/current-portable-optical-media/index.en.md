comments: This entry is highly dependent on who is looking after the portable
  media but made more difficult over time. The lack of granularity in the
  definition means that only general advice can be offered, such as to refresh
  media. In time, it may yet be more useful to split all storage media (maybe
  100 items long) with an indication of how long these can be expected to last.
  In many cases, specialists can recover obsolete media, but the cost of
  employing them can become an aggravating condition.
case-studies:
  - comment: One example, presented to the Council through a 2023 nomination,
      concerns the loss of digital materials stored in DVDs. A 3,500 DVD ‘film
      collection’ was destroyed during the fire at the University Library
      Archives and Special Collections, University of Cape Town, South Africa.
      There were no backup copies in large part because of the
      (mis)understanding that they were prevented by copyright from making
      backup copies. This example extends beyond the loss of material in the
      optical media, particularly in respect to backups and issues surrounding
      copyright, but in the context of the entry shows how aggravating factors
      can place content at greater risk due to aggravating factors not only to
      copyright but also global warming with more such fires, floods and natural
      disasters to be expected.

**2023 Review**

The 2019 Jury introduced this entry to ensure that the range of media storage is properly assessed and presented. The 2020 and 2020 Juries, and 2022 Taskforce, agreed with the entry’s assigned risk classification with no noted changes towards increased or reduced risk (no change to trend).

The 2023 Council agreed with the risk classification of Endangered with the overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend). Additionally, the Council recommended that a nomination received for ‘DVDs produced under copyright’ would provide a valuable example to this entry rather than as a new, standalone entry.

**2024 Interim Review**

These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
