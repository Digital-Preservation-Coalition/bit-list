    classification: endangered
hazards: Lack of skills, commitment or policy from corporate owners; conflating
  backup with preservation; loss of original recordings; lack of preservation
  voice at executive level; poor planning and roadmap for infrastructure;
  slapdash procurement or migration to new systems; mergers and acquisitions;
  profusion of corporate systems; uncertainty over IPR or the presence of
  orphaned work; single point of failure; technical protection measures that
  inhibit reasonable preservation actions.
mitigations: Backup and documentation; use of open formats and open source
  software; data management planning; licensing that enables preservation;
  corporate preservation capability; resilient to hacking; authenticity and
  integrity managed; recognition of preservation functions at executive level;
  technology watch; preservation audits; participation in the preservation
  community.

  This entry has five aspects to consider: 1. It falls outside the scope of
  traditional regulatory frameworks and archiving has not yet been included in
  any legislative framework, unlike broadcast TV, where there is a designated
  archive in most developed nations. 2. As a result, the collection and
  preservation of content from online platforms is underdeveloped, and the
  content remains unavailable in public archives. 3. These risks are mitigated
  by the fact that the commercial archives are technologically advanced, with
  mature digital ecosystems and skills, and much of the content has a ‘long
  tail’ business model, and as commercial products have value, preservation
  incentives are clear. 4. However, these are often stored at scale on LTO
  tapes, and so specific issues arise with the obsolescence of LTO tape
  technologies for the broadcast sector. 5. Nonetheless, issues remain around
  archiving relevant assets which may not be valued by the production company.


  It may also be worth considering broadening legal deposit legislation so there is a mandate to deposit this content with an appropriate repository - though the volume may be unwelcome as many institutions are under-resourced.
case-studies:
  - comment: Work by the BFI National Archive in 2023 in the UK. A formal agreement
      with Netflix in 2022 was followed by a similar agreement with Amazon Prime
      Video in Summer of 2023, and by October 2023, the digital preservation
      workflow for curator-selected UK Netflix content was established, with two
      complete seasons (20 episodes) under preservation, and throughput
      building.

This entry was added in 2019 to represent collections that are highly significant in cultural and social terms. It was adopted as the Jury was unclear whether the content could be played outside of the producers’ publication platform, with technical dependencies between content and software amplified by rights management. The 2020 and 2021 Juries agreed with the *Endangered* classification, with discussions around how the growth of content produced with no or limited preservation mandate leads to greater risk. The continued scale of that growth and opacities regarding preservation by companies also led to the 2022 Taskforce noting a trend towards even greater risk. However, just as the 2022 Taskforce was completing its work, they welcomed the news of BFI taking on responsibility for the preservation of key titles from Netflix, commenting on how it represents a commitment to act on previous recommendations but not yet a ‘material improvement’ at that stage so there was no change to the 2022 trend at that time.

The 2023 Council agreed with the *Endangered* classification, with the overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend). 

The 2024 interim review concluded that these risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
