  In the International organizations realm, more and more of these investigative missions are being set up. They are collecting huge volumes of data and the same issues around chain of custody, integrity records/checks continue to be aggravating especially with respect to authenticity and admissibility. Given the potentially huge volumes of data, and the drive to keep costs low, it is debatable whether there will be sustained funding for preservation.

  Case files and correspondence are one thing: retention of these should be clear but may differ widely between jurisdictions and levels of government. If retention is not long-term or permanent, the risk of loss may not be so critical. Retention of 'unused' or 'potential' evidence is likely a different matter altogether. Is it even a record? Certainly, it is not a record of the court. Should it be returned to the suspect or accused? Are their rights being considered here - not just in terms of preservation, but also simply disposition? There may be legal and ethical issues around this that need to be fleshed out in conjunction with assessing its preservation risk.

  Police forces tend only to have the resources to maintain forensic capability with relatively recent technology - for older technology, institutions and specialist companies are the only sources of expertise. This has an impact on cold cases.

  There have been many examples of convictions being overturned when previously unused evidence was brought to light. Therefore the retention and preservation of unused evidence can have immense value.

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2019 as an entry made in 2017 for ‘Digital Legal Records and Evidence,’ which the Jury split into four more discrete entries. This category includes evidence prior to court that may form part of an investigation or gathering of evidence but which are not formally submitted as evidence. It recognizes that police and other investigating authorities are not limited in the types of evidence that they need to administer, but that this creates an almost unbounded limit of preservation requirements to ensure authenticity and admissibility. A 2021 risk was identified based on examples bringing to question whether legal bodies have the skills and capabilities to preserve these materials should they need them if a case is reopened etc. The 2022 Taskforce found no significant trend towards greater or reduced risk.

The 2023 Council agreed with the Critically Endangered classification with the overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend).

**2024 Interim Review**

These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
