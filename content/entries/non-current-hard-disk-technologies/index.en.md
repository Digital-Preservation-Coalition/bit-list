title: Non-current Hard Disk Technologies
description: "Materials saved to storage devices with a variety of underlying
  magnetic or solid-state technologies that are hardwired into a computer that
  is no longer under warranty or supported: typically, hard disks more than five
  years old."
examples: Disks installed into computers or servers that are more than five
  years old, or out of warranty
categories:
  - Integrated Storage
threats:
  - Hardware/Media
classification: critically-endangered

    trend: no-change
    classification: critically-endangered
  - year: 2024
    trend: no-change
    classification: critically-endangered
hazards: Lack of replication; poor storage; non-standard connections or
  controllers; aggressive compression; encryption; Uncertainty over IPR or the
  presence of orphaned works
mitigations: Maintenance schedule; renewable extendable warranty; best practice
  storage and operation; replication

comments: >-
  A lot of early PCI-E flash devices (e.g. Fusion-IO) used proprietary drivers
  before the NVME standard was developed, but are now dropping off support.
  Intel has stopped development of Optane non-volatile RAM, some of which
  required specific CPU support to access although that form was usually used
  for data caching rather than storage.


  Accessing drives with pre-SATA interfaces is increasingly difficult since interface cards and OS support can be hard to come by.


  The greater density of newer disks, as well as encryption and compression, mean they can be more fragile than older disks with less density, and less sophisticated read/write technologies. The age of a disk is not the best or only indicator of its reliability.

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2019 to ensure that the range of media storage is properly assessed and presented. The lifecycles of most consumer hard disk technology are relatively stable in comparison to portable devices because they are integrated into systems and therefore inherit the lifecycle and replacement of the entire system. This is less true at scale; however, where disks are used in storage arrays, and refreshment is more loosely tied to the server architecture. Storage at scale also means the percentage likelihood of finding a disk failure increases, and this likelihood of failure led to the 2021 Jury’s noted trend towards greater risk. It was reviewed in 2022 with no noted change towards even greater or reduced risk.

The 2023 Council agreed with the current Critically Endangered classification with overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend), while also noting a greater inevitability of loss from the discontinuation of support and development for these storage technologies when compared to the 2021 Jury review.

**2024 Interim Review**

The 2024 Council agreed These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
