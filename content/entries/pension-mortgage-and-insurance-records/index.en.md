title: Pension, Mortgage and Insurance Records
description: Records of transactions for long-lived financial products and
  services contracted between individuals and corporations. These records
  typically contain or depend on significant amounts of personal information and
  outlast the infrastructure on which they were created.
examples: Applications, correspondence and ancillary records relating to
  pensions, mortgages and insurances and other contracts of long duration. This
  includes corporate databases, email, web archives and EDRMS, and may require
  some coordination of paper, microfiche, born-digital and digitized records.
  These records often include the scope and duration of the contract as well as
  any agreed changes during the lifetime of the product. It may also include
  evidence of mis-selling or other sharp practice, which only becomes apparent
  after the fact. This entry pertains to corporate records rather than personal
  records

    classification: vulnerable
  - year: 2024
    trend: no-change
    classification: vulnerable
hazards: Lack of corporate preservation planning; lack of preservation within
  the procurement of corporate systems; companies conflating backup with
  preservation; loss of integrity and authenticity; loss of context and
  connections to provide meaning; lack of preservation capability within
  agencies; lack of preservation voice at executive level; poor planning and
  roadmap for corporate infrastructure; proliferation of legacy systems;
  slapdash procurement or migration of new systems; mergers and acquisitions
  leading to confusion of corporate systems; lack of compliance, audit or
  accountability at operational levels; encryption; Uncertainty over IPR or the
  presence of orphaned works owners.
mitigations: Backup and documentation; use of open formats and open source
  software; considered data management planning; licencing that enables
  preservation; preservation capability in designated repository; resilient to
  hacking; selection and appraisal in place; authenticity and integrity of
  records managed; resilient funding and recognition at executive level;
  technology watch; regular preservation audits; accreditation and participation
  in the professional preservation community.

comments: The importance of retaining documentation in any kind of legal
  agreement offers this kind of material more protection than most but legal
  organizations may conflate backup with preservation and not always have
  consistent records management systems.

      EDRMS Preservation Toolkit, may be helpful for guidance in this context.

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2017 but was outside the competence of the judges to assess at that time. It was assessed in 2019 with additional expertise invited to the panel to support this assessment and reviewed again in 2020. The 2021 Jury agreed with the 2019 assessment and subsequent 2020 review, which classified these digital materials as Vulnerable with no trend towards greater or reduced risk.

The 2023 Council agreed with the Vulnerable classification with the overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend).

**2024 Interim Review**

The 2024 Council recommends that a major rescoping of the Sensitive Data category is necessary, with plans to remove it as a category and incorporate key elements and examples to relevant entries for the next 2025 Bit List. This is because it is not clear how sensitive data works as a category, when many of the other categories mentioned could have sensitive data concerns, and the sensitivity of the data is more like an extra category of risk that potentially applies across any categories.
