title: Current Portable Magnetic Media
description: Materials saved to magnetic tape, portable hard disks or other
  magnetic media in the last five years where the reader devices are still
  supported and can be integrated easily into hardware infrastructure.
examples: LTO tapes; portable hard disks.
categories:
  - Portable Media
threats:
  - Hardware/Media
classification: endangered
imminence: 3
effort: 2
trends:
  - year: 2023
    trend: no-change
    classification: endangered
  - year: 2024
    trend: towards-greater-risk
    classification: endangered
hazards: Poor storage conditions; encryption; digital rights management;
  uncertainty over IPR or the presence of orphaned works; lack of replication;
  lack of documentation; lack of periodic testing; lack of refreshment pathway;
  lack of access to readers; out of manufacturer warranty or no warranty;
  storage within paper files.
mitigations: Regular review and testing; replication; refreshment plan;
  comprehensive documentation; high quality storage; regular maintenance of
  readers; multiple readers available.

  This entry is highly dependent on who is looking after the portable media but
  made more difficult over time. The lack of granularity in the definition means
  that only general advice can be offered, such as to refresh media. In time, it
  may yet be more useful to split all storage media (maybe 100 items long) with
  an indication of how long these can be expected to last. In many cases,
  specialists can recover obsolete media, but the cost of employing them can
  become an aggravating condition.


  It is important to emphasize that the short lifetime of many storage devices is not a problem to be solved with new long-lasting storage technologies (and indeed, many inventions have come and gone). Cheap commodity storage has been purposely designed to deliver value at a low price for a short time. Therefore, management and preservation processes for monitoring and refreshment need to take these characteristics into account.

**2023 Review**

This entry was added in 2019 to ensure that the range of media storage is properly assessed and presented. The 2019 Jury noted magnetic media is typically more fragile than optical media because it is susceptible to ‘bitrot’ and magnetic damage in ways that optical media are not. The 2021 Jury commented on how the types of magnetic media used had improved the last five years, notably the use of LTO, increasing good practice and therefore identified a 2021 trend towards reduced risk in this respect. They added it is important to note that LTO tapes come in different generations. Some pose greater preservation risks now (e.g., an organization with no equipment or way of reading content), so the use of LTO is good practice so long as it includes the active management of associated risks. The 2022 Taskforce agreed the risks remained on the same basis as before (no change to trend).

The 2023 Council agreed with the risk classification of Endangered with the overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend).

**2024 Interim Review**

The 2024 Council identified a trend towards even greater risk in consideration of how magnetic tape, and data tapes, are also very much dependent on the readers and software that is used to access and write to them.

Additionally, those in the Integrated Storage category raised areas of potential overlap with the Portable Media category (see ‘Current Hard Disk Technologies’). As people increasingly select other storage methods, such as cloud, they are less likely to maintain existing content on portable hard disks, which means the portable hard disks are more likely to be overlooked or ignored (e.g., left in drawers) rather than checked and refreshed. Questions arise concerning hard drives and SSDs packaged as portable devices, and for this reason further cross-category review is recommended for the next 2025 review.
