title: Non-current Portable Magnetic Media
description: "Materials saved to floppy disks, tape, portable hard disks or
  other numerous magnetic storage devices where the media is out of warranty and
  reader devices may no longer be supported or integrated easily into hardware
  infrastructure: typically, more than five years old."
examples: Floppy disks; tape; certain kinds of portable hard disks, zip drives.

hazards: Poor storage; inability to access readers; no replication; encryption;
  aggressive compression; uncertainty over IPR or the presence of orphaned
  works.

    comment: The Magnetic Tape Alert Project, Information for All Programme (IFAP)
      of UNESCO, in cooperation with IASA, the International Association of
      Sound and Audiovisual Archives, to alert stakeholders of the imminent
      threat of losing access to their audiovisual documents. The project
      included a survey of existing audiovisual documents on magnetic tape not
      yet digitally preserved.

  There is no ‘active management’ of data found on these media items. The data
  should be copied off of the media and into a digital preservation system that
  allows for active management. Data found on these media should be considered a
  backup, at best.


  We know what to do with this type of material, it is the scale that makes it a problem.


  There is really no excuse for using floppy disks for storage these days. Tape is a different proposition since it allows high-density back up offline and nearline. But there are challenges with the backward compatibility of popular and even relatively recent LTO versions.

The 2019 Jury introduced this entry to ensure that the range of media storage is properly assessed and presented. Portable magnetic media is ubiquitous but is fragile not just to physical wear and tear but also to magnetic interference and bit-rot. The substrates of the disks can prove unstable, and in some cases, proprietary reader technology means that the disk becomes obsolete before it degrades. Storage at scale also means the percentage likelihood of failure increases. The 2021 Jury and 2022 Taskforce agreed with the entry’s assigned risk classification with no noted trend towards increased or reduced risk.

The 2023 Council agreed with the risk classification of _Critically Endangered_ with the overall risks remaining on the same basis as before (‘No change’ to trend). Additionally, a new entry ‘Non-current Rare Portable Magnetic Media’ was created as a split, related standalone entry to highlight the increased risk.

The 2024 Interim Review Council agreed These risks remain on the same basis as before, with no significant trend towards even greater or reduced risk (‘No change’ to trend).
