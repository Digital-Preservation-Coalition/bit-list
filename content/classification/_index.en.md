---

Based on an evaluation by the Bit List Council, each entry is assigned a risk classification. This takes into consideration the imminence of action required to safeguard the material, the effort required to preserve the material and the inevitability of loss. In each case, the context in which the digital material exists, as well as the presence of aggravating factors, are used to guide the evaluation.
