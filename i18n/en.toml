organisational-threats-description = "Organisational threats to digital materials are risks that come from within an organisation. These can be political, human, or legal in nature. For example, if a company goes through major changes or shuts down, its digital assets may be lost or become inaccessible. Other risks include a lack of awareness, interest, funding, or the necessary skills to properly preserve digital materials. Complex systems or unclear responsibilities can also overwhelm staff or lead to important files being overlooked. Additionally, if there are no consistent policies or procedures, some materials might be wrongly excluded from preservation. Even when an organisation has the resources and willingness to preserve digital content, legal restrictions can sometimes prevent it."

complexity-threats-description = "Complexity threats arise when it's unclear who owns the data or who has the right to access it. This can happen with data stored on specific platforms, data that is proprietary, or data meant only for short-term use—like messages on chat apps that aren’t designed to be saved. Another issue is data that lacks proper metadata or has inconsistent information, making it difficult to find, interpret, or preserve."

content-threats-description = "Digital content encompasses the files, metadata and storage media essential for preservation. Content threats arise when integrity is compromised, metadata is inaccurate or incomprehensible, and the appropriate storage media is no longer available to ensure retrievability – thus many Content threats are likely to overlap with Organisational and Technical threats. Any one of these Content threats may lead to loss of accessibility, authenticity and integrity."

technological-threats-description = "Obsolescence and a lack of standards are central to technological threats to digital preservation. As older hardware, software and file formats become outdated or unsupported, this makes it difficult or even impossible to access or read digital materials created with them. For example, files stored on floppy disks or created with now-defunct software may no longer be accessible without specialized tools or emulators. At the same time, the lack of widely adopted standards for file formats, metadata, and preservation practices may lead to inconsistencies in how digital materials are stored and managed. Without standardization, it becomes harder to ensure long-term accessibility, interoperability, and authenticity of digital content across different systems and over time."
